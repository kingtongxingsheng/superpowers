## Waiting on children

`wait_agent` is an event subscription, not a poll: a long wait wakes
the moment a child produces mailbox activity, with the same latency as
a short one. Short-timeout polling buys nothing and costs a tool call —
and a context rebill — per poll. In measured sessions, roughly
two-thirds of all wait calls were short polls that timed out.

- While you still have local work, do not wait at all. A completed
  child's final answer is pushed into your mailbox and arrives with
  your next turn.
- When you are genuinely idle with children outstanding, wait in
  bounded stretches: `wait_agent` with `timeout_ms` 300000-600000
  (5-10 minutes). After each stretch — wake or timeout — post one
  status line, run `list_agents`, and chase any child that finished
  without reporting. Never stack polls shorter than five minutes; the
  event subscription wakes a bounded stretch just as fast as a short
  one.
- Completion mail cannot wake an idle controller (it is delivered
  without triggering a turn); covering that idle window is
  `wait_agent`'s only job. A stretch that times out with no activity
  is your cue to reconcile, not to shorten the next stretch.

## Model routing on spawns

Every `spawn_agent` you issue — including when you are yourself a
spawned child running a fan-out — sets `model` AND `reasoning_effort`
explicitly, per the Model Selection rules of the skill you are
executing. Setting `model` alone is a trap: the child's effort
silently resets to that model's default, not to yours.

Ask your human partner to add a machine-level backstop to
`~/.codex/config.toml` so any spawn that slips through still routes to
a deliberate tier instead of silently inheriting the session's most
expensive model:

```toml
[agents]
default_subagent_model = "<a mid-tier model from your spawn allowlist>"
default_subagent_reasoning_effort = "medium"
```

## Environment Detection

Skills that create worktrees or finish branches should detect their
environment with read-only git commands before proceeding:

```bash
GIT_DIR=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
GIT_COMMON=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
```

- `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON` → already in a linked worktree (skip creation)
- `BRANCH` empty → detached HEAD (cannot branch/push/PR from sandbox)

See `using-git-worktrees` Step 0 and `finishing-a-development-branch`
Step 1 for how each skill uses these signals.

## Codex App Finishing

When the sandbox blocks branch/push operations (detached HEAD in an
externally managed worktree), the agent commits all work and informs
the user to use the App's native controls:

- **"Create branch"** — names the branch, then commit/push/PR via App UI
- **"Hand off to local"** — transfers work to the user's local checkout

The agent can still run tests, stage files, and output suggested branch
names, commit messages, and PR descriptions for the user to copy.
